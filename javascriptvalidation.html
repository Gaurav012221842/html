<!-- Form validation normally used to occur at the server,after the client had entered all the necessary 
data and then pressed the submit button.

if the data entered by a client was incorrect or was simply missing ,the server would have to send all the 
data back to the client and request that the form be resubmtted with correft information. This was
really a lengthy process which used to put a lot of burden on the server.

Javascript provides a way to validate form's data on the client's computer before sending it to the web
server. -->
